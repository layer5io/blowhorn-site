# What runs when the app is closed

Closing the app stops the window, not the work. The background service
keeps running the schedule: one pass every ten minutes, claiming due
rows and writing the ledger, with no window open and no person
watching. Quitting pauses nothing and resumes nothing; the pause
scopes keep exactly what they said.

The service is per-user, registered from the app or with
`blowhorn service install`. It restarts itself between passes, reports
its heartbeat for `schedule status` and the popover, and writes
per-job logs beneath the log directory. `service stop` waits for the
pass in flight before stopping; `service restart` picks up a changed
definition between passes; `service uninstall` stops and removes it
whole. The service screen shows who registered it and whether it runs.

Keep-running is the one setting that matters here. With it on,
installing the app installs the service and quitting leaves it
running; with it off, quitting ends scheduled posting until you open
the app again. Login Items in System Settings decides whether the
service returns after a reboot. If registration fails, the app says so
once in a notification rather than failing silently every pass.

Updates reach a closed app through the same service. The update card
in the popover installs the new build and relaunches; when the app is
closed, the next open shows the card instead. A release is one
universal DMG per desktop tag, downloaded from the release page; the
app installs it into Applications and relaunches when this machine
can, and otherwise opens the release page for you.
