# Why Blowhorn uses your own Chrome

Platforms trust people, not programs. A post that arrives from a
browser you signed in to, carrying your session, your history, and
your ordinary behavior, reads as you. A post from a datacenter browser
that never slept reads as automation. Blowhorn therefore acts in the
Chrome you already use, and reaches for an API only where the platform
offers one it can honestly use.

The extension drives your signed-in Chrome: the tabs you have open, on
the sites Blowhorn acts on, with the sessions you made by hand. There
is no second browser to sign in to, no session to export, and nothing
that rots when a cookie expires except the session itself, which you
renew by signing in again. Scheduled passes drive the same Chrome
through the same extension; an unattended run never waits for a person
at a sign-in or a challenge, it stops and says so.

Slack, Bluesky, and GitHub post through their APIs above the browser,
because those calls carry a token, not a pretense. Everything else
drives Chrome, because anything else would be a poorer copy of you.

Chrome is never launched headless, and never swapped for bundled
Chromium. A headless Chrome announces itself in every request while
its hints still claim Google Chrome, and the bundled build announces
itself in both. Either would mark the run as automation to every site
it touches. An unattended run takes the minimized background window
instead: invisible, but honest about what it is.

What a site sees is therefore your own user agent, your own session,
and input delivered as real keystrokes and clicks with human pauses
between them. That honesty is also the limit: a CAPTCHA or a
second-factor challenge hands back to you, always, because passing it
for you would stop being you.
