# How Blowhorn works

Blowhorn is a social media console that takes one message and
broadcasts, reposts and amplifies it across every profile and platform
your community runs, on autopilot. Five parts do it together.

The app is what you see: the menu-bar popover and the console. It shows
the queue, the schedule, the runs, and the settings, and it installs
updates. It never posts on its own.

The engine is what acts: `blowhorn <command>` run from the app, the
background service, or your terminal. Every run resolves its profiles,
reads the queue, reaches Chrome or an API, and writes the ledger. The
same engine answers the app's screens, so the app can never offer what
the engine does not know.

The extension is how the engine reaches your signed-in Chrome. It
carries out the clicks and keystrokes the engine queues, inside the
Chrome profile you already use, on the sites Blowhorn acts on. It makes
no requests of its own.

The background service is what runs the schedule while the app is
closed: one pass every ten minutes claiming the rows that are due.
Quitting the app never pauses it; pausing is explicit, per machine,
per organization, or per row.

Your organization's store is what the parts share: the content rows,
the schedule, the profiles and their credentials, the ledgers, and the
run history. Your Mac holds the app, the engine, and your Chrome
sessions; the store holds everything the Macs share.

A post travels this path: a row in the queue, approved and due; a run
acting as the row's profile; the platform reached through your Chrome
or its API; the outcome written back to the row and the ledger. Any
step the run cannot confirm stops the run instead of guessing: the row
reads clicked, outcome not read, and waits for you.
