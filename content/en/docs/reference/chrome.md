# Chrome reference

How Blowhorn finds and reaches your Google Chrome. Every browser run
reads the profile mapping first and refuses a profile without one,
before anything opens. This page describes; the steps live in the
how-to guides under Related.

## What it reads, and what it never reads

`blowhorn chrome` reads two files under Chrome's data directory,
`Local State` and `DevToolsActivePort`, and nothing else: never
cookies, saved passwords, storage, or the keychain. It writes nothing
there and opens no browser, DevTools, or network connection. Whether
Chrome is running is one bounded process lookup.

## The mapping

Each Blowhorn profile maps to one real Chrome profile on this machine,
kept in the store and keyed by hostname. The mapping does not follow
you to another machine.

`blowhorn chrome profiles` lists every profile Chrome knows, with the
directory name and the display identity. Chrome does not have to be
running. `blowhorn chrome suggest` prints a proposed mapping for every
Blowhorn profile the store knows. `blowhorn chrome map <profile>
<directory>` writes one mapping; it checks the directory exists in
Chrome and refuses a name Chrome no longer has. `blowhorn chrome unmap
<profile>` removes one mapping. A mapping is identity, never
permission: it says where the run acts, not what it may do, and there
is never a fallback to another profile.

## Launch modes

How the run reaches Chrome once the mapping holds:

- The extension default: the run drives your signed-in Chrome through
  the Blowhorn extension. No second browser, no Allow dialog in the
  happy path.
- Attach (`cdp`): the run attaches to the Chrome you have open over the
  debugging protocol. Needs a window open and the Allow dialog
  approved; a scheduled pass gets a short Allow window.
- Launch (`persistent`): the run launches Blowhorn's own Chrome from
  the automation directory, minimized in the background.

Chrome is never launched headless and never replaced with bundled
Chromium: a headless run would announce itself to every site.

### The extension default

The extension driver starts no Chrome and launches no Playwright. One
mapped profile holds the bridge per run; a second run that wants it
while it is held stops with `another blowhorn run holds the Chrome
extension bridge` and does nothing. A hello that omits the run's
version, or an installed extension older than the run needs, stops as
`extension_outdated` naming both versions. Anything the extension
cannot do is refused by name.

Under the extension default, `blowhorn profile auth` is a sign-in by
hand: it opens the platform's sign-in page once in your mapped Chrome
profile, types nothing, and waits a bounded time for you to finish
signing in, then confirms the session once.

## `blowhorn chrome status`

Whether Google Chrome is installed, whether it is running, and whether
its debugging switch is on. On macOS the installed path is
`/Applications/Google Chrome.app`; on Linux the `PATH` names and
`/opt/google/chrome/chrome`. A missing Chrome stops the run with
`ChromeNotInstalled` before any driver starts.

## Flags

`--profile` and `--chrome-profile` pin one Chrome profile for one run.
`--chrome-launch` pins the launch mode for one run. `--pace`,
`--headless`, and `--dry-run` behave as they do everywhere.

## Linux

The `extension` and `persistent` drivers run on Linux as on macOS; the
`cdp` attach driver is macOS only. Chrome is found by its `PATH` names
and `/opt/google/chrome/chrome`. Everything else on this page reads
the same.

## A dedicated attach Chrome (no Allow dialog)

`blowhorn chrome attach-chrome` starts a second Chrome on a tree of
its own (`~/.blowhorn/attach-chrome`), open to remote debugging, so
`--chrome-launch cdp` can attach unattended with no Allow dialog.
Chrome 136 and later ignore the debugging switch on the default data
directory, which is why this is never your daily Chrome. `status`
reads that tree's two files and opens nothing; `start` launches Chrome
detached and prints the steps that finish the setup. It writes no
configuration: pointing `chrome.data_dir` at the tree stays your
explicit next step. A recorded port is evidence a Chrome is up, not
proof a connect would succeed.

## `blowhorn chrome extension-install`

Writes the native-messaging host file Chrome launches to reach the
local Blowhorn app. Re-run it after moving the checkout or
reinstalling the app; without a current host file the extension cannot
talk to the engine.

## What a site sees: the user agent by driver

Your own user agent, on every driver. The extension and attach drivers
run inside your installed Chrome, so sites see the same agent string
your ordinary browsing sends. The launch driver starts that same
installed Chrome, never bundled Chromium, which would announce itself
as HeadlessChrome. A `--headless` request becomes the minimized
background window for exactly this reason: headless Chrome sends
`HeadlessChrome` in every request while its hints still claim Google
Chrome.

## `blowhorn chrome extension-status`

Whether the extension is installed, which version answers, and whether
it says connected. A version older than the run needs is the
`extension_outdated` refusal above.
