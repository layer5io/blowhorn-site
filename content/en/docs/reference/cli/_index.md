# CLI reference

Every command, the flags they share, and how a profile is resolved.

## CLI Usage (Subcommand UX)

Blowhorn now uses a command-first UX:

```
blowhorn <command> [flags]
```

Legacy `--action ...` mode is removed.
Use `blowhorn -h` (or `blowhorn --help`) to view help and command examples.

**Every command's `--help` carries a description specific to that command and at least one worked example**, and commands with genuinely distinct modes carry one example per mode - a source, a platform, a sentinel value, or the preview-then-`--apply` pair. Where a command has a `--dry-run` or a preview posture, at least one example leads with it, so nothing in the help text sends, posts, or connects for real without saying so. Sentinel values are spelled out rather than left to be discovered: `--limit 0` means target-only mode on `follow` and "no limit" on `schedule tick`.

This is a standing rule, not a one-off pass. `tests/test_cli_help_coverage.py` enforces it structurally - every registered command must expose a non-empty description and an examples epilog containing at least one example that runs that very command; no two commands may share a description or an examples block; and every example in every epilog is parsed by the real argument parser, so an example naming an option that does not exist fails the suite. A new command therefore cannot ship without contextual help and examples.

CLI framework: Python `Typer` (inspired by modern CLIs like `docker`, `kubectl`, and `gh`).
If `typer`/`click` are missing, `blowhorn` attempts a one-time bootstrap install via `python -m pip install typer click` using the active interpreter.
Should that bootstrap fail, `blowhorn` falls back to an argparse parser built from the same help and example constants as the Typer app, and the same test file asserts the two surfaces expose the same commands with identical prose - so the fallback can never drift into a second, staler help text.
For a fresh virtualenv, install the full project runtime with `pip install -r requirements.txt`; the CLI depends on `PyYAML`, `requests`, `playwright`, `tweepy`, `psycopg`, `pandas`, and `xlrd` in addition to `typer` and `click` (`gspread` and `oauth2client` are still listed only for the migration script's last step and go with it).

Global flags (available on all commands):

```
--profile <name|p1,p2,...|all>
--platform <bluesky|github|hn|linkedin|reddit|slack|x|all>
--exclude <p1,p2,...> (alias: --e)
--log-dir <directory>
--tee-stdout
--headless
--headed
--chrome-launch <auto|cdp|persistent|extension>
--dry-run
--pace <fast|normal|slow|NUMBER>
-v, --verbose
--config <path>
```

`all` is a reserved alias, not a real profile name. When you use `--profile all`, Blowhorn expands to all configured profiles and then removes any names passed via `--exclude` / `--e`.
Use `--exclude none` when you want to clear configured default exclusions for a single run.
When you pass explicit profile names with `--profile your-profile,second-profile`, those named profiles are processed even if they appear in the configured exclusion list.
Chrome is never run headless. With `--headless`, Chrome puts `HeadlessChrome/<version>` in the `User-Agent` header of every request while its client hints still say Google Chrome, which tells every site the run is automated. So `--headless` now means *unattended*: the browser opens as a background window (minimized, kept out of the foreground, the same window a flagless run opens), and no one is waited for at a sign-in or challenge. Use `--headed` when you want the window visible and in front so you can finish a sign-in yourself. `blowhorn schedule tick` runs its jobs unattended but never forces visibility onto them - each job resolves its own from its params, then the environment, then Settings - so scheduled jobs never wait for someone who is not there whatever the window does. `trigger-now` runs its one row attended, so it may wait for you.

`--headed` and `--headless` are one choice with two spellings, so exactly one of them survives resolution. `--headed` wins a tie, but only from an equal or higher-precedence layer: `defaults.headed: true` in `.blowhorn.yaml` does **not** cancel a `--headless` typed on the command line or set through `BLOWHORN_HEADLESS`. A run that passes `--headless` opens the background window whatever the file says.

Blowhorn drives only the installed Google Chrome: `/Applications/Google Chrome.app` on macOS, `google-chrome` or `google-chrome-stable` on `PATH` or `/opt/google/chrome/chrome` on Linux ([Linux](/docs/reference/chrome/#linux); Chromium is not supported yet). When it is missing, every browser-backed command refuses with one sentence instead of starting Playwright's bundled Chromium, whose user agent and client-hint brands both read `HeadlessChrome`. The refusal comes before the browser driver is started and ends the command with exit 1: a `--profile all` run stops there rather than repeating the sentence for every profile and platform and finishing as if it had run.

`--chrome-launch <auto|cdp|persistent|extension>` says how this run reaches that Chrome, for one run: `extension` (the default) drives Chrome through the [Blowhorn Chrome extension](/docs/reference/chrome/#the-extension-default) and starts no Playwright Chrome; `persistent` launches Blowhorn's own Chrome from `chrome.automation_data_dir` with the mapped Chrome profile directory inside it, `cdp` attaches to a Chrome that is already open (it must be `ready` per `blowhorn chrome status`; your daily Chrome asks you to Allow the first connection of the run, a [dedicated attach Chrome](/docs/reference/chrome/#a-dedicated-attach-chrome-no-allow-dialog) does not, and the run works in its own visible window), and `auto` attaches when Chrome is ready and launches otherwise, saying `using blowhorn chrome (persistent): <next step>` once on stderr when it falls back. Resolved as the flag, then `BLOWHORN_CHROME_LAUNCH`, then `BLOWHORN_BROWSER_DRIVER`, then `defaults.chrome.launch_mode` in `.blowhorn.yaml`, then the built-in `extension`; `BLOWHORN_EXTENSION_ROLLBACK=1` selects `persistent` in place of `BLOWHORN_BROWSER_DRIVER=extension`, the file's value or the built-in; any other value is refused before anything runs, naming the four. Every browser run needs the profile mapped with `blowhorn chrome map` first, in either mode: an unmapped profile you named is `ERROR` and exit 1, one reached through `--profile all` is one `WARNING` line and the walk continues. A job `blowhorn schedule tick` or `trigger-now` runs resolves its own driver: the job's driver mode, then `BLOWHORN_BROWSER_DRIVER`, then `defaults.chrome.launch_mode`, then the built-in `extension`, with `BLOWHORN_EXTENSION_ROLLBACK=1` beating a job's `extension` as it beats `BLOWHORN_BROWSER_DRIVER=extension`, the file's value and the built-in; `blowhorn schedule tick` and `trigger-now` hand their `--chrome-launch` to every job they run, and a `tick` with none of its own leaves the launch mode unset so each job resolves its own; an explicit `--chrome-launch` on the tick still wins. `trigger-now` keeps a launch mode only when `--chrome-launch` or `BLOWHORN_CHROME_LAUNCH` chose it; otherwise its job resolves its own mode the same way. A forced `cdp` against a Chrome that is not ready is refused with `chrome status`'s next-step sentence; the run tells you to click Allow before it connects and waits up to 120 seconds for it; a connection still unanswered then is refused by name. A job `schedule tick` runs is unattended: it is told nothing and waits 20 seconds, so it fails by name rather than hangs. `trigger-now` is attended and gets the 120-second window and the notice. `blowhorn chrome status` shows the mode a run would use right now; see [Launch modes](/docs/reference/chrome/#launch-modes) and [Choose how Blowhorn reaches Chrome](/docs/how-to/settings/launch-mode/).

`--pace` controls the speed of randomised delays between actions. Use a preset name (`fast` = 0.5×, `normal` = 1.0×, `slow` = 2.0×) or any positive number as a multiplier (e.g. `--pace 0.25` for quarter-speed delays, `--pace 3` for triple). The default is `normal`. Can also be set via the `BLOWHORN_PACE` env var or the `pace` key in `.blowhorn.yaml` defaults; the precedence is always the flag, then the env var, then the config key.

`--pace` is a global flag: every command and subcommand accepts it, and so does the root, so `blowhorn --pace slow post --profile your-profile`, `blowhorn schedule --pace slow tick` and `blowhorn post --profile your-profile --pace slow` all mean the same thing (the flag nearest the subcommand wins when more than one is given). Commands that never sleep - `auth`, `config`, `desktop`, `service`, `store`, `uninstall`, the read-only `schedule` and `profile` subcommands, `report`, `analytics history` / `operations` - still accept it, still resolve it through the same chain and still reject an unrecognised value, but it changes nothing about how they run beyond the `Pace` column of the `-v` summary; each of them says exactly that in its own `--help` rather than implying a delay it never takes.

For commands that support multi-profile execution (`post`, `accept`, `follow`, `unfollow`, `comment`, `analytics`, `report`), you can pass `--profile all` or a comma-delimited subset such as `--profile profile-a,profile-b` to run only that set of profiles.

All commands accept `--dry-run`, but they do not all preview the same amount. `post`, `report`, `find`, `withdraw`, and `accept` run their real pipeline with every write suppressed, so they print what *would* happen. (`withdraw` goes further: preview is its default and it acts only when you pass `--apply` - for it `--dry-run` simply forces the preview it would have produced anyway. `accept` does the same on the received-invitations page: it opens the page, resolves the same Accept controls a real run would click, names everyone it found, and clicks nobody - see [Accepting incoming invitations](/docs/how-to/grow/accept-invitations/).) The remaining action commands - `follow`, `unfollow`, `comment`, and `analytics` - stop immediately and report `dry-run: no changes made` without doing any work. (`source --platform github` lists the audience and, on `--dry-run`, writes nothing; a real run stores one row per login and prints no email address.) (`follow --platform github` is the one exception inside that list: it has no browser to stop before, so its preview performs the real follower walk and names exactly who would be followed - see [Previewing a GitHub follow run](/docs/how-to/grow/follow-on-github/#previewing-a-github-follow-run).) (`unfollow` runs on Bluesky only, with `--platform bluesky --target <handle>`, and its `--limit` is accepted and not read. On X, or with no platform, the platform is refused by name before a browser opens and the run exits 1, dry run included: X unfollow does not run until a follow-back badge and a confirmed landing are both read. `unfollow` cannot be scheduled.) `schedule`, `desktop`, `service`, `store` and `uninstall` are not covered by that sentence: they implement their own dry-run output (for example `schedule tick --dry-run` reports the rows it would run, `service start --dry-run` prints the command it would run, `store --import --dry-run` prints the import report without writing the connection file, and `uninstall --dry-run` lists every item it would remove or keep). Either way nothing is published.

Because the `COMMAND SUMMARY` footer is shown only when `-v` / `--verbose` is used, a dry run of one of the stop-early commands prints nothing at all without `-v` - except `source --platform github`, which lists the audience it would store. That silence is expected, not a failure.

Top-level commands:

```
post      accept    withdraw  follow    source
unfollow  comment   analytics report    find
profile   config    schedule  desktop   service
store     chrome    auth      slack     uninstall
```

`blowhorn auth` is a group of three: `auth status` reports whether a Layer5 Cloud
token and organization id are configured (never the token value), the api base,
enforcement mode, a summary of the last entitlement attestation, and why the
last read of the plan failed when it did;
`auth login` is not available yet (set `BLOWHORN_CLOUD_TOKEN` instead);
`auth logout` clears the local attestation cache. During early access your
Blowhorn administrator sets up the token and organization id.

`blowhorn store` is a single command, not a group: it reports whether this
machine can reach the Blowhorn database and why not, opens the bastion tunnel
when nothing is listening, and with `--import` fills the connection once from
meshery-cloud. It exits 3, a code nothing else uses, when the store is
unavailable. During early access the connection is set up by your Blowhorn
administrator. `blowhorn config get
<key>` reads one option and says which document holds it.

`blowhorn uninstall` is a single command: it removes Blowhorn from this
machine, in order - the background service (`ai.blowhorn.service` and the
Outbox-era `io.layer5.outbox.service` / `com.outbox.scheduler`, booted out and
their LaunchAgent files removed), the Chrome native host (the
`com.blowhorn.chrome_extension` manifest and the Outbox-era
`com.outbox.chrome_extension` / `com.outbox.actuator`, their launchers under
`~/Library/Application Support/Blowhorn` and `Outbox`, and the every-profile
install entries `chrome extension-install --all-profiles` wrote), the
`~/.local/bin/blowhorn` launcher and the `outbox` shim (only when they carry the
installer's marker), `/Applications/Blowhorn.app` and `Outbox.app` (the
service label they registered is booted out with the service, and each bundle
first unregisters its own Login Items entries - open at login and the
background service - by running `--unregister-login-items`; a bundle whose
`Info.plist` does not advertise that flag, or a call that fails, is reported
`not unregistered` with System Settings > General > Login Items named as the
step left to you), and the checkout's virtualenv (`--venv-dir`, else
`BLOWHORN_VENV_DIR`, else `venv/`, removed only when it holds `pyvenv.cfg`; the
filesystem root, the home directory, the checkout and a directory holding
either are refused), `node_modules/`, `desktop/node_modules/` and `logs/` -
reporting each item as `removed`, `not present`, `not checked`, `kept`,
`not unregistered` or `failed`. A failed item does not stop the run; the
command exits 1 at the end, as it does when a real run leaves a login item
not unregistered. Local data is kept and named (the store connection file, the
desktop app's state, Blowhorn's own Chrome trees under `~/.blowhorn`, the app's
per-user Library state, the checkout's `cache/` and each profile's `browser/`
sessions); `--purge` removes it after you type `purge` at the prompt, or with
`--yes` when there is no terminal (`--json --purge` needs `--yes` outside a dry
run, and `--yes` without `--purge` or `--discard-unsynced-runs` is refused), and the shared store is never touched.
Nothing under a Chrome profile is read or written. It is refused by name, in a
dry run too, while a scheduler tick, a service pass, an extension run,
`Blowhorn.app`, a desktop app started from this checkout or, with `--purge`,
a Chrome on `~/.blowhorn` or `~/.outbox` is running, and in every mode while a
write-back spool (`runs/pending-store.ndjson`) this run removes - under the
checkout's `logs/`, or the app's state under `--purge` - holds run records that
have not reached the shared store - run `blowhorn store --replay-spool` first,
or pass `--discard-unsynced-runs` when the store will never be reachable again,
which names the count it deletes and asks you to type `discard` (`--yes` with no
terminal or under `--json`). A spool in any other log directory is left in
place and reported as kept, with its count. A probe that could not run is a refusal too, and an unreadable `engine.json`
is listed as not checked. `--dry-run` lists every item and removes nothing;
`--json` emits one object (`ok`, `error`, `dry_run`, `purge`, `platform`,
`refusals`, `not_checked`, `items` with a `result` each, `kept`,
`unsynced_runs_given_up`, `unsynced_runs_kept`, `discard_unsynced_runs`,
`store_touched: false`); `--bin-dir` and `--venv-dir` mirror `install.sh`'s.
`./uninstall.sh` at the checkout root (and `make cli-uninstall`) runs the same
code with the system Python once the venv is gone, reading
`defaults.chrome.data_dir` and `defaults.logs.directory` from `.blowhorn.yaml`
itself. macOS only; Linux and any other platform are refused by name.

`blowhorn chrome` is a group of eight: `chrome profiles` lists the profiles the
installed Google Chrome knows (directory, display name, signed-in account, the
last-used one marked, and the Blowhorn profile each is mapped to on this
machine), `chrome status` reports whether Chrome is installed, running and open
to remote debugging with one next-step line when something is off, `chrome
suggest` prints a name-matched mapping proposal and applies nothing,
`chrome map <profile> <directory>` / `chrome unmap <profile>` are the mapping's
only writers, `chrome attach-chrome [status|start]` reports or starts a
dedicated second Chrome that is open to remote debugging with no Allow dialog
(`~/.blowhorn/attach-chrome`, on a port Chrome picks), writing no configuration of its own,
and `chrome extension-install` writes the native-messaging host manifest Chrome
launches (`com.blowhorn.chrome_extension.json`) and the executable launcher it names, removes
the older `com.outbox.actuator` host manifest and launcher when those are the files it wrote,
keeps and names the pre-rename Outbox host (`com.outbox.chrome_extension.json`) unless
`--remove-legacy` is given, and prints
the unpacked `extension/` directory to load. If you already installed the host, run the
command again and reload the extension once. `--profile <name>` (through this machine's
mapping) or `--chrome-profile '<directory>'` names one Chrome profile and prints the steps to
load the extension in that profile alone. `--all-profiles` also asks Chrome to
install the extension in every Chrome profile on this machine (the policy by default,
or `--external` for the offer in each profile). `--dry-run` prints the paths,
the host manifest, and the policy: on macOS only the `ExtensionInstallForcelist`
fragment of the shared plist (other keys in that file are preserved and not
printed), on Linux the exact JSON Blowhorn's own `blowhorn.json` must contain,
preserved keys included. It writes nothing.
It does not launch Chrome. `chrome extension-status` reports whether the extension
is installed, which install route is on disk, and whether the Chrome extension answers hello. It reads the manifest, the
launcher, the policy and the socket, stats the external-extensions file and does not read it, and writes only the bridge lock, exiting 0 whatever it
reports.
All but `chrome unmap`, `chrome extension-install` and `chrome extension-status` read two files under a Chrome data
directory (`Local State`, `DevToolsActivePort`) and nothing else - `attach-chrome`
reads the dedicated tree's pair rather than the daily one's; `chrome unmap`
reads only the store, so a mapping can be removed when those files are gone;
`chrome extension-install --all-profiles` also reads `Local State` in the
configured Chrome data directory, only to name each Chrome profile there, and
does not list profiles outside that directory. The policy route applies the
extension to every Chrome profile on this machine. It does not read `DevToolsActivePort`;
`chrome extension-status` reads the manifest, the launcher, the unpacked
extension, the policy file, and the Chrome extension socket it says hello to, stats the external-extensions file and does not read it, and writes nothing but the
bridge lock beside that socket; while a run holds the bridge it says so and
writes no hello.
Only `attach-chrome start` starts a browser, and it never drives the one it
starts. All carry a stable `--json` shape; every detail is in the [Chrome reference](/docs/reference/chrome/),
the procedure in [Map Blowhorn profiles to Chrome profiles](/docs/how-to/set-up/map-chrome-profiles/).
The mapping is identity, never permission, and nothing that runs a browser
reads it yet. The directory is `defaults.chrome.data_dir` /
`BLOWHORN_CHROME_DATA_DIR`. `blowhorn profile status --chrome` shows the mapping
from the profile's side.

`blowhorn slack` is a group of three for an agent that answers in Slack as a
person: `slack send` sends one message as one `--profile` (a thread reply from a
message link, using the link's `?thread_ts=` parent, or a top-level post from a
channel link), `slack whoami` asks Slack's `auth.test` who that profile's
credential is, and `slack profiles` lists every profile's captured workspaces
from the store without calling Slack (a profile whose `config.yaml` still
carries Slack keys while the store holds no session reads `refused`, as its
send would be). `send` is a dry run unless `--confirm`,
and stays one under `--dry-run`, `BLOWHORN_DRY_RUN` or `defaults.dry_run` even with `--confirm` (its message then names that setting),
takes its text from `--message`, `--file` or stdin (`-`) and sends it untouched,
and sends a given idempotency key at most once: a key already sent replays its
`ts` and permalink (the record is the store's send ledger), and a send whose answer was never recorded (interrupted, or still in flight) is reported as
`outcome_unknown` (exit 4) and never resent automatically. All three take
`--json`, print no secret, open no browser, and choose the credential with
`--slack-auth`. Exit codes: 0 sent, replayed or previewed; 1 refused; 2 usage or
key conflict; 3 store unavailable or a contended key; 4 outcome unknown; 5 rate-limited (with
`retry_after`). See [Slack Messages](/docs/reference/platforms/#slack-messages).

Desktop app:

```bash
blowhorn desktop status
blowhorn desktop install
blowhorn desktop start
blowhorn desktop build
```

The human-readable desktop command output groups its status details and labels
successful, missing, and failed states. On an interactive terminal those states
are colorized; `--json` always returns the unchanged machine-readable result,
and setting `NO_COLOR` disables terminal color.

`blowhorn desktop start` records the spawned pid (and its log path) under
`logs/desktop/.desktop-start` in the checkout and refuses a second start while
that pid is still alive, reporting the existing pid and log path and exiting
non-zero. `--log-dir` moves the log file and never that record, so a second
start with a different `--log-dir` is refused the same way. `--wait` records
this process instead and clears the record when the app exits. A claim whose
pid is dead is ignored and rewritten. If the pid is alive but no longer the
desktop app (a reused pid after an unclean kill), the refusal names the file to
delete: remove `logs/desktop/.desktop-start` and start again.

Command → supported platforms (central mapping):

| Command | Supported Platform(s) |
|---------|------------------------|
| `post` | `linkedin`, `x`, `reddit`, `slack`, `bluesky`, `github`, `all` - `github` is amplify-only |
| `accept` | `linkedin`, `all` |
| `withdraw` | `linkedin`, `all` |
| `follow` | `x`, `bluesky`, `github`, `all` |
| `source` | `github` |
| `unfollow` | `bluesky` |
| `comment` | `reddit`, `linkedin`, `bluesky`, `all` |
| `analytics` | `linkedin`, `x`, `bluesky`, `all` |
| `report` | `all` |
| `find` | `bluesky`, `all` |
| `profile` | `linkedin`, `x`, `reddit`, `slack`, `bluesky`, `all` |
| `config` | `all` |
| `schedule` | every platform above (see below) |
| `desktop` | `all` |
| `auth` | `all` (accepted and ignored) |
| `service` | `all` |
| `store` | `all` (accepted and ignored: the command reads no platform) |
| `chrome` | `all` (accepted and ignored: the command reads no platform) |
| `uninstall` | `all` (accepted and ignored: the command reads no platform) |
| `slack` | `all` (accepted and ignored: the command is Slack's own) |

Every action command rejects a platform outside its own row, naming the
platform and listing what it does support. Each command's `--help` states its
own accepted values - its row of this table, or that the option is ignored
there - so `--platform` never sends you looking elsewhere for them.

**An unsupported platform is rejected where it is used, and is inert
everywhere else.** `blowhorn profile auth --platform github` used to report "no
profiles have accounts for the requested platform(s)" - a false statement about
your credentials, since GitHub has no browser login session for `profile auth` to
refresh. It now gives the honest error
naming `github` and listing what `profile` supports, whether you typed the
platform or inherited it from `BLOWHORN_PLATFORM` or `defaults.platform`.

The commands that never look at `--platform` do not reject anything:

- `config path/show/get/set`, `desktop`, `service`, `store`, `chrome` and `slack` ignore the option entirely -
  their `--help` says so. A bad platform default can never lock you out of
  `blowhorn config show`, the very command you would run to find it.
- `schedule` reads it as a filter over scheduled rows, and accepts every
  platform a row may carry.
- `profile current/list/switch` never read it.
- `profile auth --all` refreshes a fixed list and ignores `--platform`
  entirely, so an unsupported platform is inert there too.

`schedule` is the one row that is not "what this command acts on". It dispatches
whatever a schedule row names, and its `--platform` filters those rows, so every
platform a row may carry is accepted here. A row is still validated against its
own command's row of the table, so a `github` schedule row is a `follow` or a
`post` (amplify).

`--profile all` is supported for `post`, `accept`, `follow`, `unfollow`, `comment`, `analytics`, `report`, and `find`, and is always treated as an alias expansion (never a concrete profile).

`blowhorn source` collects people into the store. `--platform github` requires at least one repeatable `--repo` (`owner/name`) and takes `--audience` (default `stargazers`: `owner`, `contributors`, `forks`, `stargazers`, `watchers`, `subscribers`, `issues`, or `all` only when you type it), and `--platform all` is rejected. `--limit` caps how many people a run examines; omitted, there is no cap. Once that many have been examined the run stops without pulling another login. A `--repo` that is blank, or that is not a single `owner/name` (a URL included), is rejected by name. A GitHub run lists that audience with the profile's stored `GH_TOKEN` and upserts one `github_contacts` row per login. `--dry-run` lists the audience, fetches no commit patches, and writes nothing. Email addresses are not printed. `source` is not a scheduled command, and it does not accept `--profile all`.

`service install`, `service update` and `service stop` wait for the label to leave launchd after a bootout - `launchctl bootout` returns before the resident service has exited, and a bootstrap inside that window fails. The wait is bounded (a fixed poll interval times a maximum number of attempts covering a full drain); `stop` prints what it is waiting on and carries `stopped`, `waited_s` and the pass's pid in `--json`, and every one of the three exits 1 rather than bootstrapping over a label that has not gone. Each `launchctl` call is itself bounded at 60 s.

For `follow --profile all`, if any `--target` handle matches one of your configured profile handles **on the platform being run**, that profile is auto-excluded to prevent self-targeting. The match is per platform: owning the X handle `yourhandle` says nothing about a GitHub run, which compares against the roster's `GitHub` handle instead. In `--limit 0` target-only mode, `--target` also accepts a comma-delimited list such as `example-handle,another-handle`.

### `--profile` and `--exclude` {#section-profile-and---exclude}

Naming profiles explicitly makes `--exclude` inert: `--profile your-profile` runs `your-profile` even when the
config excludes it, and only `--profile all` defers to the exclusion list. Commands say which
way it went - `Excluding profiles: …` when the list is applied, `Ignoring configured exclusions
(…): --profile named the profiles to run explicitly.` when it is not. They used to print the
first line either way, so a run could announce excluding a profile it was about to process.

`blowhorn follow` folds its target-owned auto-exclusion into the same list, so an explicit
`--profile` overrides that too. Multi-platform commands that filter per profile inside
`browser.iterate_profiles` are the exception: those exclusions always apply, and that command
says so plainly.

Profile workflows:

```
blowhorn profile current
blowhorn profile list
blowhorn profile status                       # what each profile is set up for, no browser
blowhorn profile status --check-sessions      # read-only session probes, recorded per profile
blowhorn profile status --profile your-profile --check-platform github  # one platform only: your-profile's GH_TOKEN in the store against GitHub, no browser
blowhorn profile status --chrome              # adds the chrome profile each one is mapped to here
blowhorn profile get your-profile                     # settings with secrets masked (GH_* from the store)
blowhorn profile set your-profile EMAIL=you@example.com
blowhorn profile set your-profile GH_TOKEN=ghp_yourtoken  # stored in the store, never in config.yaml
blowhorn profile set new-profile --create EMAIL=new@example.com   # its row in the store's profiles (bound to the Layer5 Cloud user holding the email), then the directory from the template
blowhorn profile set new-profile --create EMAIL=new@example.com --subject <uuid>  # name the Layer5 Cloud user when the email alone cannot
blowhorn profile set new-profile --register           # add a profile that exists only under profiles/ to the store's profiles
blowhorn profile delete new-profile --yes      # retires the store row, then moves profiles/new-profile to profiles/.trash/
blowhorn profile switch your-profile
blowhorn profile auth --platform x            # a sign-in records the session as valid, checked now
blowhorn profile auth --platform bluesky --profile your-profile  # prompts for handle + app password; saved only if Bluesky accepts the login
printf '%s\n' "$APP_PASSWORD" | blowhorn profile auth --platform bluesky --profile your-profile --handle you.bsky.social --app-password-stdin --json
blowhorn profile auth --platform reddit --profile all --exclude ""
blowhorn profile auth --all
```
