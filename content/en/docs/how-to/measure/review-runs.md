# Review what ran

Every action run appends one line per profile and platform to the run ledger,
dry or real. Read it back in the app's "runs" screen, or grouped any way you
like:

```bash
blowhorn analytics operations --group-by host
blowhorn analytics operations --group-by profile --since 7d
blowhorn analytics operations --kind tick
```

`--group-by` takes `profile`, `platform`, `command`, `day` or `host`: the
ledger has always recorded which machine a run happened on, so grouping by
host shows who did what across the machines sharing your organization. `--kind
tick` aggregates the scheduler's own passes instead of the action runs.

A dry run counts apart and never as an operation: a preview is not work done.
Records exist from the first run after this command shipped, so an older
window reports zero rather than history.

To re-run a failure, run its command again by hand or trigger its row; a dry
run first shows what the retry would do.
