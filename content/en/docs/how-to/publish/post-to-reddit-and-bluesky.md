# Post to Reddit and Bluesky

Queue posts for Reddit and Bluesky from content rows, then publish them
with `blowhorn post`.

## Reddit: post to a subreddit

Set `Title`, put the text in `Message Text`, and put the subreddit in
`Destination` as `r/<sub>`:

```bash
blowhorn content upsert --payload '{"Platform":"reddit","Profile":"kate","Title":"Meshery v0.9 is out","Message Text":"What is new in this release...","Destination":"r/meshery","Approved?":"yes"}'
blowhorn post --platform reddit --profile kate --dry-run
blowhorn post --platform reddit --profile kate
```

A title longer than 300 characters is cut short with a warning. A row
with no subreddit in `Destination` or `Amplify` is skipped with an error
naming the row.

A comment on a thread is a `Comment on` row, and an upvote is an
`Amplify` row; both are on their own pages.

## Bluesky: post and thread

Put the text in `Message Text`. Past 300 characters the post splits into a
thread at word boundaries:

```bash
blowhorn content upsert --payload '{"Platform":"bluesky","Profile":"kate","Message Text":"Meshery v0.9 is out...","Approved?":"yes"}'
blowhorn post --platform bluesky --profile kate --dry-run
blowhorn post --platform bluesky --profile kate
```

A thread that stops part-way is recorded with what landed and never
retried: re-running it would post the landed part twice. Read the run's
`!!!` line before you touch that row again.

A row with `Image URL` attaches that file. A comment on a post is a
`Comment on` row, on its own page.

## Bluesky: repost

Put the post's Bluesky URL in `Amplify` and leave `Message Text` empty:

```bash
blowhorn content upsert --payload '{"Platform":"bluesky","Profile":"kate","Amplify":"https://bsky.app/profile/meshery.bsky.social/post/abc","Approved?":"yes"}'
```

Unlike LinkedIn reposts, a Bluesky repost is not guarded against a second
run: once the row is done, leave `Date Promoted` alone.
