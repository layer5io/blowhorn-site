# Choose how Blowhorn reaches Chrome

Most runs should keep the default: Blowhorn drives Chrome through the Blowhorn
Chrome extension and launches nothing of its own. Change it only when one run
or one job needs a real Chrome window. Advanced page: the default is the right
choice until you have a reason.

## Before you start

Every profile the run acts for must be mapped to a Chrome profile first. A run
refuses an unmapped profile by name in every mode. `blowhorn chrome status`
reports which mode a run would use right now, and every run names the driver
it used once.

## The default: the extension

With nothing set, a run drives your mapped Chrome profiles through the
extension. It opens one mapped profile per process, a scheduled job included,
and refuses by name what the extension cannot do yet. During early access your
Blowhorn administrator helps you install it.

One case needs another mode today: the extension's typing does not reach X's
editor or sign-in form, so X posts and X sign-ins stop before anything is
typed. Run those with `--chrome-launch persistent`.

## Launch Blowhorn's own Chrome

```bash
blowhorn post --profile ada --chrome-launch persistent
```

For one shell instead of one run: `BLOWHORN_CHROME_LAUNCH=persistent`. To move
the whole process back to launching: `BLOWHORN_EXTENSION_ROLLBACK=1`.

The run launches Blowhorn's own Chrome from its automation directory, with
your mapped Chrome directory as the profile inside it. No allow dialog ever,
and it runs beside your open daily Chrome without contending for its lock.
Each automation profile starts empty, so sign it in once with `--headed`
before a real run.

## Attach to the Chrome you have open

```bash
blowhorn post --profile ada --chrome-launch cdp
```

Mac only. The run connects to your open Chrome, Chrome asks you to allow the
connection once per run, and Blowhorn's tab opens in the mapped profile. The
dialog has no "remember me", so every run asks again: this is an interactive
mode, for runs you watch. Never pin an overnight job to it: with nobody there
to click allow, the job waits out the short unattended bound and fails by
name, every time.

A dialog outlives the run that raised it. Clicking allow in a leftover dialog
approves nothing: click cancel there and run again.

## An unattended attach: no Allow dialog

For the authenticity of a real Chrome profile with no dialog, run a second
Chrome on a tree of its own. Chrome 136 and later ignore the classic port
switch on the default data directory, which is why this is a separate Chrome
and not your daily one. Mac only:

```bash
blowhorn chrome attach-chrome start
```

That starts Chrome on `~/.blowhorn/attach-chrome`, prints the steps it leaves
to you, and steps back: Blowhorn never drives that Chrome itself. Do them in
order:

```bash
blowhorn config set defaults.chrome.data_dir ~/.blowhorn/attach-chrome
blowhorn chrome profiles
blowhorn chrome map ada 'Default'
blowhorn post --profile ada --chrome-launch cdp
```

On its own, `blowhorn chrome attach-chrome` reports that tree without starting
anything, and `start --dry-run` prints the command line without running it.
The profiles there start empty and are signed in once, like automation
profiles. Starting is refused when the tree is Chrome's own default data
directory, or when a port is already recorded there: a crashed Chrome leaves
its `DevToolsActivePort` behind too, so the refusal names the file to delete.

## One scheduled job, its own driver

A job names its driver in its `Driver Mode`: `default`, `extension`, `cdp` or
`persistent`. Set "browser driver" in the job editor, or the key on `blowhorn
schedule upsert`. The choice belongs to that job alone and applies to nothing
else in the pass.

Two explicit overrides still win over the job: a launch mode forced on the
whole tick (`--chrome-launch` on the tick, or `BLOWHORN_CHROME_LAUNCH` in its
environment), and `BLOWHORN_EXTENSION_ROLLBACK=1` over a job set to
`extension`. The job's log names the driver it used and says when an override
beat it.

## Where the setting is read

Top wins over everything below it, with one exception: the rollback switch
also beats a job set to `extension`, and it replaces whatever the file says.

| layer | spelling |
| --- | --- |
| one run | `--chrome-launch auto\|cdp\|persistent\|extension`, on every command |
| your shell | `BLOWHORN_CHROME_LAUNCH=cdp` |
| one scheduled job | its `Driver Mode` (`default`, `extension`, `cdp`, `persistent`) |
| debugging | `BLOWHORN_BROWSER_DRIVER=cdp` (no file key, no flag) |
| whole process fallback | `BLOWHORN_EXTENSION_ROLLBACK=1` selects launching unless a layer above decides - a job's `cdp` or `persistent`, or the variable's `auto`, `cdp` or `persistent`; a job's `extension`, the variable's `extension` and the file's value all give way to it |
| this checkout | `defaults.chrome.launch_mode` in `.blowhorn.yaml` |
| nothing set | the extension default |

A value outside the four is refused before anything runs. A forced `cdp`
against a Chrome that is not ready is refused with the next step `blowhorn
chrome status` prints; only `auto` falls back to launching, and says so once.

A scheduler tick adds no layer of its own: unless the flag is on the tick's
argv, each job resolves its own driver.

## When something refuses

| sentence | what to do |
| --- | --- |
| `profile ada has no chrome profile mapped on <host>; …` | `blowhorn chrome map ada '<directory>'` |
| `chrome launch mode is cdp but chrome is not ready: <next step>` | do the next step, or drop the forced `cdp` |
| `chrome's 'Allow remote debugging?' dialog was not answered within 120 s; …` (20 s for a scheduled job) | click cancel in the dialog still open in Chrome, run again and click allow in the new one, or run with `--chrome-launch persistent` |
| `profile ada on linkedin is in use by blowhorn process <pid>; …` | another run is acting as that profile: wait for it, or stop it |
| `… is google chrome's own data directory; …` | the dedicated tree must never be Chrome's own default directory |
