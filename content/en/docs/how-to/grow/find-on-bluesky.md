# Find conversations on Bluesky

Search Bluesky for posts matching a query, with date, author, and
relevancy filters. Read-only: results are printed, never posted, and no
browser opens.

```bash
# Name the query. It is required.
blowhorn find --query "developer relations" --profile kate

# Newest or most relevant first.
blowhorn find --query "developer relations" --sort latest --profile kate
blowhorn find --query "developer relations" --sort top --profile kate

# Narrow by date, author, mention, language, linked domain, URL, or tag.
blowhorn find --query "developer relations" --since 2026-09-01 --until 2026-10-01 --profile kate
blowhorn find --query "developer relations" --author yourproject.bsky.social --profile kate
blowhorn find --query "developer relations" --tag opensource --limit 10 --profile kate
```

The query takes Lucene syntax. `--limit` takes 1 to 100 and defaults to
25. The run authenticates as the profile, so the profile needs its
Bluesky login stored first.
