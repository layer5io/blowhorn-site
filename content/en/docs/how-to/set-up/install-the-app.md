# Install the app

Download the signed Blowhorn app for macOS, verify it, install it, and open
it.

**Early access:** the app does not bundle its command-line engine yet. On
first run it asks for a checkout of Blowhorn, which your Blowhorn
administrator gives you access to (see [First run](#first-run)).

## Download

Download the latest build from the
[blowhorn-site releases](https://github.com/layer5io/blowhorn-site/releases),
the same place the [blowhorn.ai](https://blowhorn.ai) download button links:

- [Blowhorn-mac.dmg](https://github.com/layer5io/blowhorn-site/releases/latest/download/Blowhorn-mac.dmg) -
  always the latest build, for Apple silicon and Intel Macs.
- [SHA256SUMS.txt](https://github.com/layer5io/blowhorn-site/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS.txt) -
  the checksums for that release.

Verify the download before you open it. With both files in the same folder:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt --ignore-missing
```

The line for `Blowhorn-mac.dmg` must read `OK`.

## Install

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg`.
2. Drag the app to **Applications**.
3. Open it from Applications. A notarized build opens without a warning.

You need macOS 13 or newer and Google Chrome. Chrome is not bundled: Blowhorn
drives the Chrome profiles you already sign in to, through its Chrome
extension, which you add to each Chrome profile you post from
([Install the Chrome extension](/docs/how-to/set-up/install-the-chrome-extension/)).

## First run

The app opens on its Setup screen and checks, in order, the Blowhorn
checkout, its Python environment, the connection to your organization's
data, your Chrome profile mappings
([Map Blowhorn profiles to Chrome profiles](/docs/how-to/set-up/map-chrome-profiles/)), and
the background service. Each row says what it found, or what to do next.
Every row is described under Setup in
[The Blowhorn app, screen by screen](/docs/reference/use-the-desktop-app/#setup).

Then check sessions and run a dry-run post. Nothing is published until you
post without `--dry-run`.

**Early access:** signing in with your Blowhorn account and a bundled
engine that needs no checkout are still being built. When they ship, they
replace the checkout and Python rows.

## Update

Updates come from the same releases page. The app installs an update and
relaunches when this machine can reach the releases; otherwise it opens the
release page and you download the newer `.dmg` and drag the app over the old
copy. The background service and your settings are kept.
