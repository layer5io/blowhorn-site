# Install the Chrome extension

Blowhorn drives Chrome through its Chrome extension. Chrome keeps an
extension inside each Chrome profile, and the extension drives only the
profile it is installed in. Install it in every Chrome profile you post
from.

**Early access:** the Chrome Web Store listing is awaiting review. Until it
is approved, load the extension unpacked as described below.

## From the Chrome Web Store

Open the
[Blowhorn listing](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fcflpiagmpcfifgknledeknedfopnapf)
(item `fcflpiagmpcfifgknledeknedfopnapf`) in each Chrome profile you post
from and choose **Add to Chrome**. Then confirm the extension answers:

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-status
```

An answered hello means the extension is loaded in some Chrome profile and
talking. It does not name which profile.

## Load it unpacked in one Chrome profile

When only one Chrome profile needs the extension, write the native host and
follow the printed steps. Through the Blowhorn mapping:

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-install --profile kate
```

By the Chrome profile directory, as `blowhorn chrome profiles` prints it:

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-install --chrome-profile 'Profile 12'
```

`--chrome-profile` can be given more than once. Either flag with
`--all-profiles` is refused. A `--profile` inherited from
`BLOWHORN_PROFILE` or `defaults.profile` does not count: type it on this
command.

The printed steps are: switch to that Chrome profile, open
`chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, choose **Load unpacked**,
select the `extension/` directory the command names, then check with
`blowhorn chrome extension-status`. There is no file the command can write
that installs an extension in one profile only, so this route always ends
with those clicks.

See the files first, and write nothing:

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-install --profile kate --dry-run
```

## Every Chrome profile on this machine

**Every profile** (the default) writes Chrome's
`ExtensionInstallForcelist`. Chrome installs the extension the next time
each profile starts, with no click in that profile. That is every Chrome
profile on this machine, including ones no Blowhorn profile uses. Chrome
shows **Managed by your organization**. macOS asks for an administrator
password once. Cancelling that dialog writes nothing.

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-install --all-profiles
```

**Ask in each profile** writes Chrome's external-extensions file instead, so
Chrome offers the install in each profile and you click once there. There is
no managed banner.

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-install --all-profiles --external
```

On Linux both files live where only root can write. Blowhorn never asks for
root and refuses to run under `sudo`: a write it cannot make is refused
with the file, its exact content, and the one `sudo` command that writes
that file. Write that file, then run the plain install as yourself for the
host.

## See which route is on disk

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-status
```

The report includes `Install route: policy`, `external`, or `none`. A
policy line ends `not confirmed in chrome`; an external line ends `waiting
for your click`. Those lines say what Chrome was asked to do, never that a
profile's copy was confirmed.

## From the desktop app

Settings has one **chrome extension** card. The segmented control is the
route: **every profile** or **ask in each profile**. The button stays
**install chrome extension** either way. After the command, the card lists
one row per Chrome profile with the same words the terminal prints.

## Move an install made before the extension id changed

Installs made before the current store item used the retired id
`alogghnpabnbkmhgeceffnlcbcnlpoap`, which has no store listing. After you
update, the native host accepts only the new id, so an extension still
running under the old id cannot connect until you move it:

1. Run the install again with the flags you used the first time.
2. In each Chrome profile that loaded the extension unpacked, open
   `chrome://extensions`, remove the old copy, and choose **Load unpacked**
   again with the `extension/` directory.
3. If you used `--all-profiles`, remove the old id's entry by hand: the
   command adds and removes only the current id.
4. Check with `blowhorn chrome extension-status`.

Your profile mappings (`blowhorn chrome map`) do not name the extension id
and do not change.

## Remove the host from before the rename

A plain install keeps `com.outbox.chrome_extension.json` when it is
present, and names it: a Chrome profile still running the old extension
connects through it. Load the Blowhorn extension in that profile, then
remove the old host with:

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-install --remove-legacy
```

That flag warns that a profile still on the old extension loses its
connection until the Blowhorn extension is loaded there.
