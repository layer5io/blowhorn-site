# Settle something Blowhorn could not confirm

Blowhorn clicks a public action once per run and never clicks again on a
guess. When the click lands but nothing read after it confirms the outcome,
the run records `clicked, outcome not read` and stops. That record is a hold,
not a result: only you settle it, by looking at the platform yourself.

## A content row

When no confirmation follows the click, `Date Promoted` carries `clicked,
outcome not read` with the time, no promotion link is written, and the row is
not counted as posted. No later run posts it again.

1. Open the profile on the platform and check whether the post is there.
2. If it is there, record it on the row so it stays done.
3. If it is not there, and you want a run to try the row again, clear `Date
   Promoted` with `blowhorn content upsert`:

```bash
blowhorn content upsert --row 12 --payload '{"Date Promoted": ""}'
```

Never clear the date on a guess. Clearing it re-queues the row, and if the
first click did go out, the retry publishes it twice. When in doubt, leave the
row held and ask for help instead of re-running it.

Once the sending control was clicked, the run never reports the row as not
sent. "Not sent" is kept for runs where nothing was clicked at all.
