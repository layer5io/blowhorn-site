# Fix the Chrome extension connection

When a run says the extension is not connected, ask the extension itself
first. This command opens no tab and contacts no platform:

```bash
blowhorn chrome extension-status
```

It reports whether the extension directory is installed, whether the native
host manifest is missing, current or stale against the checkout, which install
route is on disk (policy, external, or none), and whether the extension
answers hello on its socket. An answered hello proves the extension is loaded
in the real Chrome and talking.

## Not connected

Work through the report top to bottom: a missing directory or manifest means
the install did not finish, so install it again with your administrator. A
stale manifest means the checkout moved on without it: reinstall the native
host from the current checkout, then reload the extension on
`chrome://extensions`.

## Version mismatch after an update

A Blowhorn upgrade does not reinstall the extension. After an update, take the
store update, or reload the unpacked copy on `chrome://extensions`, then run
`blowhorn chrome extension-status` again until hello answers.

## Bridge busy

```text
another blowhorn run holds the Chrome extension bridge
```

One mapped profile runs in one process at a time. Another run is acting as
that profile: wait for it, or stop it. Your rows stay queued, and a scheduled
job tries again next tick.

## Profile in use

When a run says the profile is in use by another Blowhorn process, the same
rule holds under any driver: wait for that run, or stop it. The profile is
skipped and its rows stay queued.
